<p>Hi, guys. SoAwesam here.</p>
<p>I just had the craziest weekend. Friday night, I had to do my school play, Alice in Wonderland Jr.</p>
<p>Saturday morning, I completed the Communications and Graphic Arts Merit Badges(Boy Scouts) at a Merit Badge Workshop that went for six hours.
That evening, I did my third and final play for the public this year and went to a cast party afterwards. We played Manhunt, and it was super epic.</p>
<p>On Sunday Morning, I completed the Bow Lake 5K in Northwood, NH. This was my 36th 5K, and I won 3rd place for my age group at a time of 28:10.</p>
<p>Overall, it was pretty busy, but I'm glad it's all over.</p>
