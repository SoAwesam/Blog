<p>Wednesday, March 14 was <a href="http://www.piday.org/million/">Pi Day</a>. I won first prize in the entire school for reciting the most digits from memory(96).</p>

<p>Here, I'll type from memory: <tt>3.1415926535397932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445908998628034825342117</tt>.</p>


<p>I got an apple pie as a prize and tied with the all-time school record. I was amazed at the fact that I actually did that.</p>
